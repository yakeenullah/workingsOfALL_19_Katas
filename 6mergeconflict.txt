1.Use git merge to bring the changes from merge-conflict-branch1 on to master.
$ git merge merge-conflict-branch1
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in file.txt
Auto-merging file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

2. What does git status now report.
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both added:      file.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

3.Fix the conflict with your favorite editor.
4.Follow the instructions in git status to complete the merge.
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

5.What does git log --oneline --graph show?
$ git log --oneline --graph
