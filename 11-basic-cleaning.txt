1.Explore the directory with ls -R. There is a lot going on. Code files, temp files, object files,.. Let's clean up!
$ ls -R
.:
README.txt  README.txt~  obj/  src/

./obj:
a.out  myapp.o  mylib.a  mylib.o

./src:
myapp.c  myapp.c~  myapp.h  mylib.c  oldfile.c~

2.Just to be safe, do a dry run and execute the clean command with the -n option
$ git clean -n
Would remove README.txt~
Would remove src/myapp.c~
Would remove src/mylib.c
Would remove src/oldfile.c~


3.Oh noes! there's a .c file that would have been deleted!
4.Add src/mylib.c to the staging area. don't commit it.
5.Run the clean command with the -n option. Notice that mylib.c will not be deleted. Also notice that the files in the obj directory are not listed
6.Run the clean command with the -n -d option.
$ git clean -n -d
Would remove README.txt~
Would remove obj/
Would remove src/myapp.c~
Would remove src/oldfile.c~

7.Looks good! clean the repo -f -d
$ git clean -f -d
Removing README.txt~
Removing obj/
Removing src/myapp.c~
Removing src/oldfile.c~
